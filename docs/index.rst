Welcome to Tianshou!
====================

**Tianshou** (天授) is a reinforcement learning platform based on pure PyTorch. Unlike existing reinforcement learning libraries, which are mainly based on TensorFlow, have many nested classes, unfriendly API, or slow-speed, Tianshou provides a fast-speed framework and pythonic API for building the deep reinforcement learning agent. The supported interface algorithms include:

* `Policy Gradient (PG) <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf>`_
* `Deep Q-Network (DQN) <https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf>`_
* `Double DQN (DDQN) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf>`_ with n-step returns
* `Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) <https://openai.com/blog/baselines-acktr-a2c/>`_
* `Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf>`_
* `Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf>`_
* `Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf>`_
* `Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05905.pdf>`_


Tianshou supports parallel workers for all algorithms as well. All of these algorithms are reformatted as replay-buffer based algorithms.

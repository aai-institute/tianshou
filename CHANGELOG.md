# Changelog

## Release 1.1.0

### Api Extensions
- Batch received two new methods: `to_dict` and `to_list_of_dicts`. #1063
- `Collector`s can now be closed, and their reset is more granular. #1063
- Trainers can control whether collectors should be reset prior to training. #1063
- Convenience constructor for `CollectStats` called `with_autogenerated_stats`. #1063

### Internal Improvements
- `Collector`s rely less on state, the few stateful things are stored explicitly instead of through a `.data` attribute. #1063
- Introduced a first iteration of a naming convention for vars in `Collector`s. #1063
- Generally improved readability of Collector code and associated tests (still quite some way to go). #1063
- Improved typing for `exploration_noise` and within Collector. #1063

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `.data` attribute from `Collector` and its child classes. #1063
- Collectors no longer reset the environment on initialization. Instead, the user might have to call `reset` 
expicitly or pass `reset_before_collect=True` . #1063
- VectorEnvs now return an array of info-dicts on reset instead of a list. #1063
- Fixed `iter(Batch(...)` which now behaves the same way as `Batch(...).__iter__()`. Can be considered a bugfix. #1063
